# The Neural Hawkes Process

## Modules
Here are the modules used in the project

* controllers : combine models and optimizers
* data_processers : process data to model-friendly format
* models : define the model structures
* optimizers : define optimizers like SGD and ADAM 
* organizers : organize log files
* sequence_generators : sample sequences using Thinning Algorithm (in the paper)
* testers : test statistical significance
* utils : initialize model weights, etc
