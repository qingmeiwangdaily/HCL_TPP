* [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) - Computational graphs are built on Theano

### Prepare Data
Download datasets to the 'data' folder

### Train Models
To train the model, try the command line below for detailed guide:
```
python train_models.py --help
```

### Test Models
To evaluate (dev or test) and save results, use the command line below for detailed guide:
```
python test_models_and_save.py --help
```

### Generate Sequences
To generate sequences (with trained or randomly initialized models), try the command line:
```
python generate_sequences.py --help
```

### Significant Tests
To test statistical significance by boostrapping over dev/test set, try the command line:
```
python generate_sequences.py --help
```
