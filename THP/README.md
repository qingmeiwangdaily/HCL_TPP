# Transformer Hawkes Process

Source code for [Transformer Hawkes Process (ICML 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09291).

# Run the code

### Dependencies
* Python 3.7.
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) contains all the required packages.
* [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) version 1.4.0.

### Instructions
1. Put the data folder inside the root folder, modify the **data** entry in **run.sh** accordingly. The datasets are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwqmV0EcoUc8UklIR1BKV25YR1U?resourcekey=0-OrlU87jyc1m-dVMmY5aC4w&usp=sharing).
2. **bash run.sh** to run the code.

### Note
* Right now the code only supports single GPU training, but an extension to support multiple GPUs should be easy.
* The reported event time prediction RMSE and the time stamps provided in the datasets are not of the same unit, i.e., the provided time stamps can be in minutes, but the reported results are in hours.
* There are several factors that can be changed, beside the ones in **run.sh**:
  * In **Main.py**, function **train\_epoch**, the event time prediction squared error needs to be properly scaled to stabilize training. In the meantime, also scale the **diff** variable in function **time\_loss** in **Utils.py**.
  * In **Utils.py**, function **log_likelihood**, users can select whether to use numerical integration or Monte Carlo integration.
  * In **transformer/Models.py**, class **Transformer**, there is an optional recurrent layer. This  is inspired by the fact that additional recurrent layers can better capture the sequential context, as suggested in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09408.pdf). In reality, this may or may not help, depending on the dataset.
